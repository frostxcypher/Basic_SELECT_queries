# Basic_SELECT_queries

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
- Opened the existing `library_management.sqlite` database in SQLiteStudio.
- Confirmed that the schema and sample data from previous tasks (table creation and data insertion) were intact and accessible.

### Step 2: Retrieved All Data from a Table
- Used the `SELECT * FROM TableName;` syntax to retrieve all columns from specific tables such as `Book`, `Member`, and `Author`.
- This helped to quickly inspect the structure and contents of each table.

### Step 3: Retrieved Specific Columns
- Applied `SELECT column1, column2 FROM TableName;` to fetch only the necessary attributes.
- Focused on retrieving key fields such as book titles, genres, and publication years.

### Step 4: Filtered Records Using WHERE Clause
- Practiced basic filtering using `WHERE` to retrieve targeted records.
- Examples included selecting members who joined after a specific date and books within certain genres.

### Step 5: Applied Logical Operators (AND, OR)
- Combined conditions using `AND` and `OR` to refine query results.
- For instance, queries were written to find fantasy books published after a specific year or books that matched multiple genres.

### Step 6: Used Pattern Matching with LIKE
- Employed the `LIKE` operator to perform pattern-based searches.
- Examples included retrieving author names starting with a particular letter or emails ending with a specific domain.

### Step 7: Used BETWEEN for Range Filtering
- Applied the `BETWEEN` operator to filter records within a range of years, such as books published between two dates.

### Step 8: Combined Clauses
- Wrote queries combining multiple clauses, including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY` to retrieve well-targeted and organized data.

### Step 8: Sorted Results with ORDER BY
- Used `ORDER BY` to sort query results either in ascending or descending order.
- Sorting was applied to fields such as publication year and member name.
